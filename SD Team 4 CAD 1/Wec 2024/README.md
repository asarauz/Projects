**Western Engineering Competition**

 In the Spring of 2024, I collaborated in a team to design and build an RC rover capable of traversing an obstacle course while collecting and disposing of magnetic materials. Our approach involved integrating various sensors and actuators, working in tandem with microcontrollers, to efficiently collect and dispose of the items. I also contributed to the design of the robot chassis and other essential components using SolidWorks. We achieved third place with our design.

Full solidworks assembly was provided
