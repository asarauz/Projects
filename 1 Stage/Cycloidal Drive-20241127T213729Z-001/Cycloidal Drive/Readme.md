Stage 1 Gearbox was first iteration.

Calculated the appropriate gear ratio for a 1 stage at 15:1.

Assembly includes motion study with working speed reduction. Note input shaft was temporary as input motor was unkown

Needed to add a second disk to minimize shaking force --> done at stage 2 for both stages. 

Needed to add a second stage to increase torque output ---> done at stage 2.
