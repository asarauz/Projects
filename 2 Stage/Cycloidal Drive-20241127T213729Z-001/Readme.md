Stage 2 Gearbox

Gear ratio now 15*15 = 225:1. Although in reality will be less due to effeciency loss

Should be noted no gasket was used for lubrication swaps. Lubrication should be added before hand as this gearbox does not experience constant rotational motion. Motor is on for short intervals to move arm up and down.

Assembly is still in working progress. 

**What it needs:**

Need to finish outer casing with fasterns 

Need to add PTFE spacers between output disk and cycloidal disk to reduce friction on both stages.

Need to incorprate shaft size into gearbox input using keys as motor was now chosen.

Need to add an output shaft on output disk 

Need to finish properly putting together completed assembly

**Partialaly finished assembly included**
