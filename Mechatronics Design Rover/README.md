**Mechatronics Rover**

The full-year design course tasked us with building a robot that could pick up gems, sort them based on color, and deposit only a specified color of gem back at a deposition station. The rover was to be fully autonomous.

Our robot was able to successfully complete the task. We used RGB sensors to detect the color of the gems and a servo motor to sweep the desired gems into a deposition bucket on the rover while sweeping the undesired ones off the rover. We used a conveyor belt with a sweeping fan to pick up the gems and bring them high enough to reach the deposition station when despoting the gems.

Solidworks Assembly was provided
